the real site will be deployed at [`sjsumsa.org`](https://sjsumsa.org/)

## running the app
- TODO: fardin, pull frontend contents out onto main repo. no need for backend so frontend can take entire repo
- `cd frontend`
- `ng serve` (install angular command line tools if you havent already `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## tech stack
built with angular and firebase
- TODO: fardin will working on initializing firebase config with this
    - note: spark plan (firebase free tier) only allows us for basic auth and data store (up to 1GB) which should be sufficient for this use case
    - add version information for ng, node, etc.

## devs see below
- read up on the stack we are using above, we can look to schedule a meeting sometime soon to discuss more about it.
- see [issues tab](https://github.com/FardinHaque60/sjsumsa/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen) on github for to do items
    - check milestones to get ideas of features in each release
- branches are created for each issue/ feature
    - make sure to `git rebase master` when working on a feature to ensure it is up to date
- assign yourself to the feature you are working on so others are aware
- update the description by striking out parts as you complete them
- communicate in the comments what parts you are working on
